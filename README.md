## Introduction

This repository contains a backend boilerplate built with Express.js, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and PostgreSQL for database management. It provides a solid foundation for building secure and scalable web applications.

## Features

- **Express.js**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.
- **bcrypt**: Hash passwords securely before storing them in the database.
